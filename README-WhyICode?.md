Hi,

I found it funny an enjoyable. And I want to start my life as programmer mostly because it is interesting and it brings me a lot of joy.
I am still noob in programming world but it so so FUN! If you can fix a problem or find a solution for something than it makes it so enjoyable and exciting.
I was sick so i could only spend 2 days for writing this code after work but i almost lost time completly when i was writing it.

Hours just went 'wuuuuuuuuuuh'. Time goes fast for me when i am programming. Mostly because i enjoy it :D
